	\subsubsection{Sprint Planning}
	As the initial sprint of the project this sprint was concerned with setting up and configuring CI/CD tools for the project. The main tool of the CI/CD process considered were a Jenkins build server to continuously build and deploy the code and SonarQube to test code coverage and quality. Given the agile developments methodology was important to implement these steps early in the project and therefore they were undertaken during the initial sprint.

	\subsubsection{Sprint Review}
	The following goals were achieved:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Jenkins build server was deployed to AWS;
		\item An AWS ECS instance to run the web app was deployed;
		\item A skeleton React app was created with a defined Dockerfile to build image of the app;
		\item A Jenkins pipeline was created to build the image of the app and deploy it to AWS on every commit to GitHub;
		\item On account on SonarCloud was created, a cloud based service of SonarQube. 
	\end{itemize}
